OMG, just walked out of O'Dessa and wow, I don't even know where to start really... I'm a mosh pit of emotions and my head's still spinning, you know, like when you're on a merry-go-round for too long but in a good way? This  ... more intense than when I lost my sock behind the washing machine, I think.

Okay, so the theater was chaos, total CHAOS. Some guy was crinkling his popcorn bag like he was trying to communicate with aliens. Distracting, but then also somehow part of experience – like, added extra layer of drama. 

That opening sequence just hit me, like BAM. Straight into it, no breathing space. And the colors, my god, the COLORS. It's like they stole the whole palette from a candy store and just threw it on screen like a toddler on a sugar rush. But I loved it, right? Like how a cat loves pushing things off tables.

> There was this one scene... gosh, how do I even describe it? When she stares out over the city, and the wind with the little papers swirling felt like a metaphor for life or something... or maybe it was just windy LOL. My back was killing me by then, and I shifted in my chair kind of like when you’re sitting on a bus that's taking too long to move. Man, I wish I could just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   straight into my brain so I could relive that part.

Echoes of the storyline are still rattling around in my brain. That twist? Didn't see it coming even if I had binoculars. And the score was like a hug and a punch at the same time, somehow wrapping you in while keeping you on edge. It was like being wrapped in an electric cotton candy cloud.

Remember someone asking me if you should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Oh, totally, 100% go for it. If you’re okay with not breathing for two hours and getting lost in something like a maze, but the maze is made of emotions and insane plot twists.

Wait, not sure how coherent this is — brain’s like scrambled eggs after this. Did I mention the character arc? No? Right. Picture a rollercoaster but instead of going up and down, it goes sideways and inside out too. No idea if that makes sense but O'Dessa does it.

I'm exhausted, going back to the bench but that was definitely worth every crumb of popcorn still in my sweater. Okay, typing ta analysis paused. Pants in code now.
